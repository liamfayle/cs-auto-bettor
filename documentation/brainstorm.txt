FEATURES:
    *For every stats have general, T, and CT versions. Also, LT (long term), and different period MAs (3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 20)*
    -KPR (kill per round)
    -KDR (kill death ratio)
    -SPR (Survival per round)
    -TDP (% share of team damage)
    -DPR (death per round)
    -ADR (Average damage per round)
    -APR (Assist per round)
    -FKR (First kills per round)
    -FDR (First deaths per round)
    -ODWR (opening duel win rate)
    -HSP (headshot percentage)
    -KAST (Average kast (already a per roun stat inehrently))
    -RWPR (Conversion [round win] per round)
    -KPR2[3,4,5] (Average multikills per round)
    -CPR (Clutch per round)
    -TKPR (trade kills per round)
    -TDDR (Traded death per death)
    -EI (economic efficiency [will have to figure out details but baseline score + points for multipliers + points for actions like kills,plants,etc])
        >EI = (Base EI * Economic Multiplier) * damage
        >base = 100, multiplier = opp_$ / our_$, 
    -PR (player rating [already calculated on per round basis])
    -MIS (baseline points for kills plus multiplier for multikills)
        >kills + kills^(sqrt(kills/5)) - 1
    -CR (clutch rate, number of clutches vs number of attempts)
    -WCR (weighted clutch rate, )
    -ACPR (accuracy per round (hits / shots) average over rounds)
    -CPK (Cost Per Kill The amount of money spent by the player for each kill they achieve. This takes into account weapon and utility purchases.)
    -EVSPR (Equipment Value Saved The monetary value of equipment (guns, armor, grenades) a player saves after rounds they survive.)
    -BPK (bullets per kill)
    -DTPR (Damage taken per round)
    -BPPA (Bomb plants per attempt) [would have to remove fakes]
    -BDPA (Bomb defuse per attempt)
    -FAPR (Flash assists per round)
    -UDPR (utility damage per round)
    -UDPI (utility damage per investment) [ud / money spent]
    -CVPR (lost clutches per attempt vs)
    -ACT (average cohesion time)
        >get number of days they have played with current team mates (per team mate)
        >average time by summing thn dividing by number of teammates
    -Past head to head results
    -Time since last match
    -Matches played in last n number of days


IDEAS:
    -Glicko on players with the gamma kills factor

    -instead of average stat bayesian shrinkage do pooled average (s,a,b) tier events
        >apply to player based on how their kpr was in s, vs a, vs b etc..

    -Expected stat models
        >create model (find relationship from scatter) to build relatiosnip based on expected stat using glicko, historical averages, etc as features. 
        >Could use this to scale an adjusted stat after match or some kind of % differnece between expected and realized

    -Z score stat adjustment
        >get average of opponents performance (maybe pooled by tier/map), use mean and std to calculate Z score of player vs that

    -Pool models by using tier / map / etc...

    -Linear regression for stats instead of bayesian shrinkage using stat + games played


FUTURE:
    -Props models (totals, round counts, game scores etc)

    -Do win % for games including current score so it can be applied round by round
